# Library Management System

This project is a Library Management System built to handle core library operations such as managing books, users, and borrowing records. The primary goal of the project is to design a clean, scalable backend with a simple and usable interface on top of it.

The system is structured to follow good software engineering practices, with clear separation of concerns and maintainable code organization.
